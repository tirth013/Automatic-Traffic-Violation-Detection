# Traffic Signal Violation Detection Using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project implements an automated **Traffic Signal Violation Detection System** using machine learning techniques. The system leverages computer vision algorithms, specifically the YOLO (You Only Look Once) framework, for real-time detection of vehicles violating traffic signals.

## Key Features

- **Data Collection:** Collected traffic data from road intersections and traffic cameras for building the dataset.
- **Preprocessing:** Data preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the dataset for model training.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Developed a YOLO-based model for real-time detection of vehicles that violate traffic signals.
- **Violation Detection:** Integrated license plate recognition using Tesseract OCR to identify vehicles and automatically issue fines.
- **Web Deployment:** Created a web interface for monitoring violations and viewing detection results.
- **Dashboard:** Provided a dashboard for visualizing traffic violation trends and system performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning:** Python, TensorFlow, YOLOv5
- **Object Detection:** YOLO for real-time vehicle and signal detection
- **Web Development:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask
