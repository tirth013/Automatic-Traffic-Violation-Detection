## Overview

Traffic Signal Violation Detection is a machine learning-powered system that uses the YOLOv5 framework for real-time detection of vehicles violating traffic signals. Integrated with license plate recognition and a web interface, it automates violation tracking and provides actionable insights through a user-friendly dashboard.

---

## Why Traffic Signal Violation Detection?

This project enhances road safety and traffic management with the following features:

### üöó **Real-Time Vehicle Detection**
Utilizes YOLOv5 for fast and accurate detection of vehicles and traffic signals.

### üì∏ **License Plate Recognition**
Employs Tesseract OCR to identify violating vehicles and automate fine issuance.

### üåê **Web-Based Monitoring**
Offers a Flask-based web interface for real-time violation monitoring.

### üìä **Insightful Dashboard**
Visualizes traffic violation trends and system performance metrics.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Scalable Data Pipeline**
Includes robust data collection and preprocessing for reliable model training.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Package Manager**: pip
- **Dependencies**: Listed in `requirements.txt`
- **Hardware**: Webcam or traffic camera feed for real-time detection (optional)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tirth013/Automatic-Traffic-Violation-Detection.git
   cd Automatic-Traffic-Violation-Detection
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Flask application:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Access the app:**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### Usage

1. **Set up input source**:
   Configure the system to use traffic camera feeds or pre-recorded videos.
2. **Run the application**:
   Start the Flask app to launch the web interface.
3. **Monitor violations**:
   Use the dashboard to view real-time detections, license plate data, and violation trends.
